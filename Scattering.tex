\begin{itemize}
\item Learn signal representations that are (1) invariant (under certain group actions), (2) stable (under certain small local, i.e.~diffeomorphic operations).
\item Modulus of Fourier transform is translation invariant, e.g.~shift in time just leads to a phase shift 
\begin{align}
\widehat{ f(\cdot -a)}(\omega) = e^{-i a\omega} \hat f(\omega)
\end{align}
\item An interesting class of functions/signals  can be described via 
\begin{align}
f(x) = e^{i \omega \cdot x} \theta(x)
\end{align}
Here, if we shift the signal proportional to $x$, $\tau(x) = sx$, $f_\tau(x) = f(x-\tau(x))$, $|s|<1$, then the $|\hat{\cdot}|$ operator is Lipschitz in $| \omega|$, which can be arbitrarily large. 
\item This sensitivity of the Fourier transform to such distortions can be counteracted by using localized functions (wavelet) instead. 
\end{itemize}
