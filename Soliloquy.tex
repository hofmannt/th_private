Pieces \& Thoughts
\begin{itemize}
\item Utterances generated by agents need to be likely sentences $\Longrightarrow$ language model
\item Language generation can be avoided at first by selecting sentences from a given corpus (finiteness assumption on possible utterances)
\item Somehow a mechanism needs to generate tasks for the agents
\end{itemize}
